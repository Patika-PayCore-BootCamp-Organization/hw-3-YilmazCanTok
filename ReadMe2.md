### PayCore Java Spring Bootcamp [2.3] Homework 3#
---


This project is about dormitory system. We will do a lot of process for students in this project. For
example we will check their informations and we will check their meal informations daily.
In this scheme, we have students which will live in dormitory. Every student has their profession,
therefore they must have their faculties and departmants. Every student has 3 meal per day. Those
meals are breakfast, lunch and dinner. Students have their qualities like; name, surname, age, first
day they entered dormitory, last day they stayed in dormitory. 
In dormitory we have functions like saving students in dormitory system. We have 2 dormitories. They
are Alaaddin and Ali Ulvi. We have delete function to remove that student in dormitories system. And
we can change student's dormitory if he wants to. Each dormitory has 2 blocks and each blocks have
rooms. 
We have 1 university and this university has 2 faculties. This will increase in next week, I am planning
to make it 4 or 5. Ä± will also add new functions for dormitory class. Cancel changes
